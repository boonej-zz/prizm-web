        p
          | Prizm makes it easy for you and your members to stay 
          | in touch privately when they’re not in your scheduled 
          | in-person activities. Prizm is an app and web tool that 
          | helps eliminate email and paper flyers for communication, 
          | gives organization leaders back actionable data for 
          | fundraising purposes, and feels like popular social 
          | apps your members are already using. It’s time to 
          | start engaging with your members in a way that 
          | makes sense to them.

          | Prizm helps you stay connected to everyone in your organization, whether 
          | they are using iPhones, Android smartphones or the web. The self-service 
          | customization that Prizm offers gives you the feeling of a custom app 
          | without having to worry about testing, coding, software  updates or bug fixes.

        p
          | Prizm’s Message feature is easy to use and familiar to teens 
          | (and you don’t need their phone numbers to use it). It’s like a live 
          | mic to your members. Send a message to start a conversation, 
          | and push notifications get sent to everyone’s smartphone. 
          | Have a message for only a subgroup in your organization? 
          | No problem! You can easily organize members into the groups 
          | that reflect your organization so messages stay on point.

        p
          | You can send helpful material to your members with Insights. 
          | Maybe there’s an online article that has great advice about 
          | writing college essays or a story about a local hero that’s 
          | particularly inspirational. Insights are a way to stay connected 
          | with your members in real time. You don’t have to wait until 
          | your next meeting or send an email that won’t get read.

          | Use Prizm’s Survey feature to learn anything from opinions on 
          | a recent guest speaker to more longitudinal information that 
          | can be shared with your board and donors. Results are 
          | automatically compiled and accessible on the web or your 
          | smartphone. The built-in group Leaderboard allows you to offer 
          | prizes or other incentives to encourage member participation.

          | Prizm gives you the tools to reflect your organization in the app 
          | right from your members’ first launch. Customize with your 
          | organization’s color scheme, pictures and subgroup names. Then 
          | invite and approve members, and adjust subgroups as needed. Prizm 
          | empowers you with information about member usage and viewed messages. 
          | You can even export group message logs for record keeping purposes.

          | Not only does Prizm make it easy to stay engaged with members, 
          | it provides organization leaders with a comprehensive view of 
          | what’s happening. Every post, hashtag, stated interest and survey 
          | response by members add up to a real time reflection of the 
          | organization’s impact. Prizm connects programming outcomes to 
          | development efforts by surfacing data for raising large donations 
          | from foundations and individuals.

        h2 Why Prizm?
        h3 Creating opportunities through connections
        p
          | We began this project because we saw firsthand how the world has 
          | changed with the adoption of mobile devices. The way people— especially 
          | teens— communicate and relate to each other has fundamentally changed in 
          | the past 10 years. Today, 73% of teenagers have or have access to a 
          | smartphone. We know that community organizations have a unique challenge in 
          | trying to engage their teen members with tools that aren’t effective anymore. 
          | Our goal is to help organizations stay relevant to their members, and teens 
          | stay connected to their clubs and organizations while learning about future 
          | opportunities like college and internships.
